# Website Overview
Over this page, I aim to document my Designs, Developements, Testing and Provide an Evaluation for my website project assignment. There are 4 distinct sections that have their own sub-sections which aim to describe and fulfil a specific portion of the criteria described in the assignment brief.

## 1 - Design
Within this section, I aim to use the requirements as specified in the brief to produce designs including Colour Themes, Styles, Layouts and Such. With these designs I establish how the website will Look, Flow and Function. 
### 1.1 - Analysing client requirements
To properly analyse the client requirements we can take a look at the Scenario and Task 1 content which outlines all relevant information. To start with, the company, "Hot Beans Web" has hired us as a junior web developer and have requested a website which aims to recruit more web developers.

Moving on to the target audience, the brief states it is as follows,
> People who have completed training courses or qualifications related to web developent and are now looking for a job as a web developer.

This is a rather simple description and as such it allows for us to have freedom when creating the upcoming designs, we should however make sure the website outlines the company's targets, allows for visitors to send applications and is not confusing in it's structure, content or layout while utilising well thought out styling including font sizes, font colours, background colours, buttons and such.

### 1.2 - Colour schemes & Typography
Moving on to our Colours, Font styling and any other relevant styling that will be used within our design, I am to create a well laid out design sheet using Adobe Illustrator that will contain content such as Font Styles, Font sizes and the Colour theme.

To get a good colour theme set up, I have noticed the image assets provided, specifically the [logo.png](assets/images/logo.png) file contains a background colour already, this will allow us to utilise the colour which is `#597A5E`, bringing this colour 2 shades up utilising Adobe Colors Complementary colour wheel we get `#A9DBB2`, we can then use this colour as our core for the Complemetary wheel producing a full-fledged set of colours that can now be used within the design and website, the full colour theme is available [here](assets/images/logo.png)
