# Website Overview
Over this page, I aim to document my Designs, Developements, Testing and Provide an Evaluation for my website project assignment. There are 4 distinct sections that have their own sub-sections which aim to describe and fulfil a specific portion of the criteria described in the assignment brief.

## 1 - Design
Within this section, I aim to use the requirements as specified in the brief to produce designs including Colour Themes, Styles, Layouts and Such. With these designs I am able to establish how the website will Look, Flow and Function. 

### 1.1 - Analysing client requirements
To properly analyse the client requirements we can take a look at the Scenario and Task 1 content which outlines all relevant information. To start with, the company, "Hot Beans Web" has hired us as a junior web developer and have requested a website which aims to recruit more web developers.

Moving on to the target audience, the brief states it is as follows,
> People who have completed training courses or qualifications related to web developent and are now looking for a job as a web developer.

This is a rather simple description and as such it allows for us to have freedom when creating the upcoming designs, we should however make sure the website outlines the company's targets, allows for visitors to send applications and is not confusing in it's structure, content or layout while utilising well thought out styling including font sizes, font colours, background colours, buttons and such.

### 1.2 - Colour schemes & Typography
Moving on to our Colours, Font styling and any other relevant styling that will be used within our design, I am utilising tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Colours and Adobe Photoshop to produce colour palletes and to edit or create illustrations that will be utilised within the website.

To get a good colour theme set up, I have noticed the image assets provided, specifically the [logo.png](assets/images/logo.png) file contains a background colour already, this will allow us to utilise the colour which is `#597A5E`, bringing this colour 2 shades up utilising Adobe Colors Complementary colour wheel we get `#A9DBB2`, we can then use this colour as our core for the Complemetary wheel producing a full-fledged set of colours that can now be used within the design and website, the full colour theme is available [here](assets/images/logo.png). To conclude this section, I wanted to also note that my main focus will be to utilise clear spacing utilising black and white components and backgrounds, I have always believed this brings out a well outlined theme that is appealing to most then, I aim to utilise the specific colours for fonts, buttons and other componenets as to highlight the focal points of each page.

### 1.3 - Wireframe
I will produce a sitemap to allow me to map out the website's pages that are utilised within the end product, to do so I will use [draw.io](https://draw.io), the exported sitemap file is also available [here](assets/design/sitemap.png).

Now, I can create a wireframe that should allow me to create the design for the website, which is available here, 

### 1.4 - Mockup
Here, I aim to create a functioning design prototype and create a fully laid out website along with its featured pages, this will allow me to effectively establish the colours, layout and features of the website before having to worry about trial and error when writing the code making the process more straightforward.
